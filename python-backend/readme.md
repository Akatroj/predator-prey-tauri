The goal of our work is to create a program that accurately simulates the predator-prey pop-
ulation dynamics. By implementing classes modelling actual animal behavior (seeking food,
mating) and the laws of nature (energy expenditure, starvation, hereditary passing of parentsâ€™
traits and random mutations), we expect to see a cyclic change in the size of both populations in
accordance to the Lotka-Volterra model. The simulation will also show how these two species
co-evolve together and which traits will be favored by natural selection
